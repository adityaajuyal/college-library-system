## üö® Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå DON'T Choose:
- **Serverless** (pay-per-use, can get expensive)
- **Dedicated** ($57+/month, overkill for college library)

### ‚úÖ DO Choose:
- **Shared** - FREE FOREVER
- **M0 Sandbox** tier
- **512MB storage** (enough for thousands of book records)

---

## üìç If You Don't See "Shared" Option

Sometimes the page layout is different. Look for:
- "M0" tier
- "$0/month" 
- "Free Forever"
- "Shared Clusters"
- "512MB storage"

These all refer to the same FREE option.
