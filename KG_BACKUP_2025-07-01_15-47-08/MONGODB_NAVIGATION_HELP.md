## 🎯 What You're Looking For:

### Page Title Should Say:
- "Deploy your database"
- "Build a Database"  
- "Create a deployment"
- "Choose deployment type"

### You Should See 3 Options:
1. **Serverless** (pay per use)
2. **Shared** (FREE - this is what you want!)
3. **Dedicated** (expensive)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Common Issues:

### Issue 1: "I only see my dashboard"
**Solution**: Look for green "Create" button, usually top-right

### Issue 2: "I see existing projects"
**Solution**: Either create new project OR click existing project then "Create Database"

### Issue 3: "Page looks different"
**Solution**: MongoDB updates their UI. Look for:
- Any button with "Create", "Build", or "Deploy"
- FREE tier options
- $0/month pricing

### Issue 4: "I'm stuck in tutorials"
**Solution**: 
- Look for "Skip" or "Skip Tour" buttons
- Or navigate to cloud.mongodb.com directly
